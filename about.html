            Destiny Estates Sober Living, owned and operated by good, gentle men in recovery, boasts a collective experience of 32 years in the realm of alcoholism and addiction. Having traversed similar paths before finding sobriety, we empathize with our residents, offering a distinctive journey guided by 12-step meetings and fostered within a family-like atmosphere.

Situated a mere two blocks away from a beautiful local park, the estate is set upon a sprawling 1.5-acre expanse with ample parking and a private, fenced-in yard featuring a shimmering pool.
